# 1. Deploy and Configure a Palo Alto NGFW VM-Series firewall _May-2021_                      
- The project aimed at creating a lab environment to route traffic through a virtual Palo Alto firewall inside a virtual env with multiple devices connected via a LAN, and perform     firewall tasks such as allowing/blocking traffic, scanning the network for vulnerabilities, configuring subscriptions, etc.   
- Technologies/Tools Used: Palo Alto NGFW VM-Series Firewall and VirtualBox. 

# 2. Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing of MyBB Forum    _Jan-2021_                     
- The project performs vulnerability assessment and penetration testing on a popular web forum MyBB. Vulnerabilities such as XSS(Persistent/Reflected), File Inclusion, and Improper Input Validation are detected, exploited, and remediated using various tools and techniques. 
- Technologies/Tools Used: Burp Suite, Vega Scanner, SQLmap, RIPS Scanner, BuiltWith, php_code_sniffer, and google dorks. 

# 3.Privacy and Security Analysis of COVID-19 related Websites and Mobile Applications    _Sep-2020_
- The project conducts privacy review and security evaluation of COVID-19-related websites and mobile apps, following static and dynamic application testing techniques to search for privacy leaks, GDPR violations, and threats that may expose the PII of a user and other sensitive details.
- Technologies/Tools Used: Fiddler, BurpSuite, Owasp-ZAP, Frida, Genymotion, MobSF, and Python.

# 4. Simulating APT Attacks & Deploying Security Measures in a VPN using OpenStack   _May-2020_
- The project implements a Virtual Private Network, with subnets, routers, and instances using OpenStack Victoria and simulates a real-world situation of threat actors and how security measures are used to counter them. 
- Technologies/Tools Used: Openstack, Ubuntu Server-18.04.4 LTS, VirtualBox, Snort, AIDE, nmap, tshark, Metasploit, etc.

# 5.Android OS â€“ Vulnerability Exploitation and Secure App Implementation   _Apr-2020_    
- In this project, I have implemented real-world attacks such as Stagefright, Privilege Escalation, Lock Suspension, and Phonesploit(ADB-exploit) on Android OS and also developed security mechanisms such as Secure Lock that conducts fingerprint validation and intruder detection, as well as a random keyboard application to prevent keylogger attacks and shoulder surfing.
- Technologies/Tools Used: Metasploit, Phonesploit, Android Studio, XML, and Gennymotion.

# 6. Wi-fi Vulnerability Assessment    _Jan-2020_   
- In this project, I have analyzed the insecurity of WLAN by performing attacks like De-Authentication attack, DNS spoofing, Denial of Service (DOS), MITM, Fake Access Point, and Password Recovery. 
- Technologies/Tools Used: Atheros Adapter (AR9271 Chipset), Ettercap, setoolkit, aircrack-ng, pyrit, hostapd, and Metasploit.
