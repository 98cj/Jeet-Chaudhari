## Projects

# 1. Deploy and Configure a Palo Alto NGFW VM-Series firewall _May-2021_                      
- The project aimed at creating a lab environment to route traffic through a virtual Palo Alto firewall inside a virtual env with multiple devices connected via a LAN, and perform     firewall tasks such as allowing/blocking traffic, scanning the network for vulnerabilities, configuring subscriptions, etc.   

- Technologies/Tools Used: Palo Alto NGFW VM-Series Firewall and VirtualBox. 

# 2. Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing of MyBB Forum    _Jan-2021_                     
- The project performs vulnerability assessment and penetration testing on a popular web forum MyBB. Vulnerabilities such as XSS(Persistent/Reflected), File Inclusion, and Improper Input Validation are detected, exploited, and remediated using various tools and techniques. 

- Technologies/Tools Used: Burp Suite, Vega Scanner, SQLmap, RIPS Scanner, BuiltWith, php_code_sniffer, and google dorks. 

# 3.Privacy and Security Analysis of COVID-19 related Websites and Mobile Applications    _Sep-2020_
- The project conducts privacy review and security evaluation of COVID-19-related websites and mobile apps, following static and dynamic application testing techniques to search for privacy leaks, GDPR violations, and threats that may expose the PII of a user and other sensitive details.

- Technologies/Tools Used: Fiddler, BurpSuite, Owasp-ZAP, Frida, Genymotion, MobSF, and Python.

# 4. Simulating APT Attacks & Deploying Security Measures in a VPN using OpenStack   _May-2020_
- The project implements a Virtual Private Network, with subnets, routers, and instances using OpenStack Victoria and simulates a real-world situation of threat actors and how security measures are used to counter them. 

- Technologies/Tools Used: Openstack, Ubuntu Server-18.04.4 LTS, VirtualBox, Snort, AIDE, nmap, tshark, Metasploit, etc.

# 5.Android OS â€“ Vulnerability Exploitation and Secure App Implementation   _Apr-2020_    
- In this project, I have implemented real-world attacks such as Stagefright, Privilege Escalation, Lock Suspension, and Phonesploit(ADB-exploit) on Android OS and also developed security mechanisms such as Secure Lock that conducts fingerprint validation and intruder detection, as well as a random keyboard application to prevent keylogger attacks and shoulder surfing.

- Technologies/Tools Used: Metasploit, Phonesploit, Android Studio, XML, and Gennymotion.

# 6. Wi-fi Vulnerability Assessment    _Jan-2020_   
- In this project, I have analyzed the insecurity of WLAN by performing attacks like De-Authentication attack, DNS spoofing, Denial of Service (DOS), MITM, Fake Access Point, and Password Recovery. 

- Technologies/Tools Used: Atheros Adapter (AR9271 Chipset), Ettercap, setoolkit, aircrack-ng, pyrit, hostapd, and Metasploit.


## Other Projects and Survey Papers

# 1. Blockchain-enabled Cyber Physical Systems : A Survey
- This survey paper was submitted as a project for the course System Physical Security (INSE 6680) during my time at Concordia University. In this article, I have shared insights on some ongoing research in Cyber-Physical Systems and systematically reviewed how blockchain can be adopted to make CPS more reliable and efficient, while, also discuss the challenges faced by these traditional CPS and to what extent blockchain addresses these issues.

# 2. Project Managment of "seCure - a security software"
- This project presents a report on how project management is performed during the development of a security software, and it involves the five phases it goes through from Initiation, Planning, Execution, Monitoring, and finally the Closing Phase.
- It includes the formal techniques used during these phases right from project proposal, project charter, SWOT Analysis, NPV-ROI analysis, Work Breakdown Structure, Risk Analysis, Quality Assurance & Control and etc.

# 3. Blockchain-Enabled Security Architecture in VANETs : A Survey
- In this survey paper which was submitted as a project for the course Wireless Network Security(INSE 6190) during my time at Concordia University, I have briefly reviewed the existing architecture of VANETs, the security issues they're facing, and also discussed how different studies have proposed technologies such as Blockchain and Edge Computing to fight over this security concerns.

# 4. CTF Player at HTB, TryHackMe and HackerOne.
